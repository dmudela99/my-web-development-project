    <h2>I AM BARRY ALLEN AND I AM FASTEST MEN ALIVE</h2>
      <br>
 <ul>
  <li> <strong>SEASON 1</strong></li>
</ul>
      <p> The series follows <em><strong>Barry Allen</strong></em>, portrayed by <em><strong>Grant Gustin</Strong></em>, a crime scene investigator who gains super-human speed,
        which he uses to fight criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities.
      Barry Allen, a forensic crime scene assistant for Central City Police Department, is struck by lightning during a storm that is created after a particle accelerator from S.T.A.R. Labs explodes. In a coma for nine months, Barry awakens in S.T.A.R. Labs, having been placed in the care of its founder Harrison Wells and his assistants Dr. Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon. Barry learns that he can move at extraordinary speeds, and that there were other "metahumans" created from the explosion. One of them, Clyde Mardon, is robbing banks with his ability to control the weather. In order to stop Mardon, Barry is outfitted with a suit, designed by Cisco, that can withstand his high speed. He tracks down Mardon and with Detective Joe West, who learns of Barry's abilities, Barry is able to stop Mardon, who is killed by Joe. With his new powers, Barry vows to exonerate his father, Henry, who is incarcerated for murdering his wife, Nora, whom Barry witnessed, at a young age, being killed by another metahuman. He chooses the alias "Flash" for his alter ego. Wells, secretly revealed to be neither paraplegic nor needing glasses, reads a newspaper from 2024 stating the missing status of the Flash.</p>
